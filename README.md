## Project Overview:

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a Python library for visualizing data. It allows us to create line plots, bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more to represent data graphically. For eg:
Let us make two python list:

x_axis = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
y_axis = [4, 5, 2, 3, 1]

plt.plot(
  x_axis,                      # Anything that needs to be in our x-axis
  y_axis,                      # Anything that needs to be in our y-axis
  marker = "o"                 # Makes the point of connection between x-axis and y-axis circular 
  markerfacecolor = "blue"     # Makes the marker's center color blue
  markeredgecolor = "red"      # Makes the marker border/edge color red
  linestyle = "-"              # Makes the --- line throughout the graph
  color = "green"              # Makes the line color green
  linewidth = 2                # Increase the width of line by 2
)










## Installation

Matplotlib library can be installed using the following command:

pip install matplotlib
conda install matplotlib









## Uses

Matplotlib is a powerful Python library used for data visualization, allowing users to represent data graphically to easily understand patterns, trends, and relationships. It supports various types of plots such as line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts, and enables extensive customization of colors, markers, labels, and titles. Matplotlib integrates seamlessly with libraries like NumPy and Pandas, making it ideal for data analysis and AI/ML projects, and also allows saving plots in formats like PNG or PDF for reports and presentations. Overall, it helps both beginners and professionals analyze, interpret, and present data effectively.
